# Walmart Store Sales Forecasting
This project is for the Practical Statistical Learning course at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. In this project, students are given a year of training data from the sales of multiple Walmart stores in various departments, and 10 sequential folds of test data, with the purpose of predicting future sales data. The goal of this project is to minimize the weighted mean absolute error between the predicted and the actual sales data.
